<h1>Independent Project Proposal</h1>
<p>For my independent project this semester I have elected to improve the design of the app concept I did two years ago for SMAD 203 called MyTrek. It was essentially to be an app targeted to JMU students looking for safer exercise routes that could not only calculate weather and traffic conditions, but also tailor their results based on their preferences and interests. In that class I only got as far as creating an extremely basic and simplified wireframe, so I plan to take it a step further by creating an interactive prototype which will include more features and design than what I had originally thought of at the time. I plan to call this project MyTrek: From Concept to Prototype. </p>
<br>
<p>My goals for this project will be to create an overall more inclusive experience than what was originally intended. The purpose of the app will remain the same, but I will expand my target  audience to include the Harrisonburg community rather than just JMU students, and hopefully create more realistically unique personas. I will also be focusing on including features that pertain primarily to the purpose of the app to create a good experience for all users, excluding unnecessary information requirements such as age or gender. I will also take into consideration handicapped users or those confined to wheelchairs. In this way, my app will not solely be confined to exercising students.</p>
<br>
<p>I am hoping to complete this project in a series of increments up until the day it is so. I plan to complete my certification and screencast by October 20. The next step will be to complete my improved research and personas by November 1. I will then, complete my first draft and user testing of my prototype by November 15, and finish the project with my final prototype and user testing video by the project due date of November 20.</p>
